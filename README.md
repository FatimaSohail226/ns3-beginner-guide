# NS-Beginner-Guide

## Overview

This project provides a collection of beginner-friendly network simulations using ns-3.29, focusing on fundamental concepts such as network topologies, point-to-point links, and basic packet transmission at the present. The examples are crafted to assist newcomers in understanding the foundational aspects of network simulation using ns-3.29
## Prerequisites

- ns-3.29 (Network Simulator 3.29)
- Basic understanding of networking concepts and C++ programming

## Installation

To get started, ensure you have ns-3.29 installed on your system. 

## Usage

To run a simulation:

1. Place the desired simulation file in the `scratch/` directory of your ns-3.29 installation.
2. Execute the simulation using the command: `./waf --run scratch/<simulation_file_name>`


## Contributing

Contributions, especially those aimed at enhancing learning for beginners, are welcome. Please adhere to ns-3 coding standards and provide ample comments for clarity.
